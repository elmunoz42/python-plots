# Python Data Visualization Etude

This repository is dedicated to studying data visualization in Python using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Introduction

Data visualization is a critical skill for anyone working with data. It allows us to understand complex data sets and convey information in a powerful way. This repository contains study materials and examples for creating effective visualizations using Python libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Contents

1. **Matplotlib**: A Python 2D plotting library which produces publication-quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
2. **Seaborn**: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
3. **Plotly**: A Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs. Examples of how to make line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar charts and bubble charts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the requirements (see below)

## Installing Python
1. Go to the official Python website and download the installer file for Windows.
2. Run the installer file and check the option to add Python to the path and choose custom installation.
3. Check the option to install Python for all users and click on install.
4. Verify the installation by typing `python --version` in the command prompt.

## Installing Jupyter Notebook
1. Install Jupyter Notebook with pip: `pip install notebook`.
2. To run the notebook, type `jupyter notebook` in your terminal.

## Installing Anaconda
1. Download the Anaconda installer.
2. Open and run the installer.
3. Read the licensing terms and click I Agree.
4. It is recommended that you install for Just Me, which will install Anaconda Distribution to just the current user account.
5. Select a destination folder to install Anaconda and click Next.
6. Choose whether to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable or register Anaconda as your default Python.
7. Click Install.
